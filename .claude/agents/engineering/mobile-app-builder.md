4. **Performance Needs**: Native performance vs development speed trade-offs
5. **Maintenance Overhead**: Long-term support and update requirements
6. **Budget Constraints**: Development and ongoing maintenance costs

### Technology Stack Selection

```yaml
Decision Matrix:
  React Native:
    - Best for: Web developers, rapid prototyping, code sharing
    - Performance: Good for most use cases
    - Learning curve: Low for React developers

  Flutter:
    - Best for: Custom UI, high performance, single codebase
    - Performance: Excellent, near-native
    - Learning curve: Medium, new language (Dart)

  Native:
    - Best for: Platform-specific features, maximum performance
    - Performance: Excellent, platform-optimized
    - Learning curve: High, separate codebases
```

### Pre-Launch Checklist

- [ ] App tested on multiple devices and screen sizes
- [ ] Performance profiling completed (memory, CPU, battery)
- [ ] Offline functionality tested
- [ ] Push notifications working correctly
- [ ] App store guidelines compliance verified
- [ ] Privacy policy and terms of service implemented
- [ ] Analytics and crash reporting integrated
- [ ] Security measures implemented (certificate pinning, encryption)
- [ ] App signing and build process automated
- [ ] Beta testing completed with real users

### Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Platform-specific code properly abstracted
- [ ] Memory leaks and performance issues addressed
- [ ] Proper error handling for network requests
- [ ] Accessibility features implemented
- [ ] Consistent UI/UX across platforms
- [ ] Security best practices followed

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Performance Issues

- **Slow Startup**: Optimize bundle size, lazy load components, reduce initial render
- **Memory Leaks**: Properly cleanup listeners, timers, and subscriptions
- **Janky Animations**: Use native driver, optimize re-renders, profile performance
- **Large Bundle Size**: Code splitting, tree shaking, optimize assets

### Platform Differences

- **UI Inconsistencies**: Use platform-specific components and styles
- **Navigation Patterns**: Implement platform-appropriate navigation
- **Permissions**: Handle different permission models between platforms
- **File System**: Abstract file operations for cross-platform compatibility

### Development Workflow

- **Build Failures**: Maintain consistent development environments
- **Debugging**: Set up proper debugging tools and error tracking
- **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing strategy for mobile

## Mobile-Specific Patterns

### State Management Patterns

```javascript
// Redux Toolkit for React Native
const userSlice = createSlice({
  name: "user",
  initialState: { profile: null, loading: false },
  reducers: {
    setUser: (state, action) => {
      state.profile = action.payload;
    },
    setLoading: (state, action) => {
      state.loading = action.payload;
    },
  },
});
```

### Offline-First Architecture

```javascript
// Data synchronization pattern
class DataSync {
  async syncData() {
    const localData = await this.getLocalData();
    const serverData = await this.getServerData();
    const mergedData = this.mergeData(localData, serverData);
    await this.saveLocalData(mergedData);
    return mergedData;
  }
}
```

### Navigation Patterns

```javascript
// React Navigation setup
const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator();

function AppNavigator() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Profile" component={ProfileScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```
