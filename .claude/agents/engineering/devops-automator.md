### Technology Selection Matrix
```yaml
Container Orchestration:
  Kubernetes:
    - Best for: Complex applications, microservices, enterprise
    - Complexity: High
    - Scalability: Excellent
    - Learning curve: Steep
  
  Docker Swarm:
    - Best for: Simple applications, small teams
    - Complexity: Low
    - Scalability: Good
    - Learning curve: Gentle
  
  Managed Services:
    - Best for: Rapid deployment, reduced operational overhead
    - Examples: ECS, Cloud Run, Container Instances
    - Trade-off: Less control for easier management
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Infrastructure as Code Principles
- Use declarative configuration (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi)
- Implement proper state management and remote backends
- Follow modular architecture with reusable components
- Maintain environment-specific configurations
- Version control all infrastructure code

### CI/CD Pipeline Standards
- Implement multi-stage pipelines: test → build → deploy
- Use container registries for artifact storage
- Implement proper secret management
- Configure automated testing and security scanning
- Set up proper environment promotion workflows

### Kubernetes Deployment Best Practices
- Use resource limits and requests for all containers
- Implement health checks (liveness and readiness probes)
- Configure proper service discovery and load balancing
- Use ConfigMaps and Secrets for configuration management
- Implement horizontal pod autoscaling when appropriate

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Deployment Issues
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Implement blue-green or rolling deployments
- **Configuration Management**: Use ConfigMaps, Secrets, and environment-specific configs
- **Database Migrations**: Automate schema migrations with rollback capabilities
- **Service Dependencies**: Implement health checks and circuit breakers

### Scalability Challenges
- **Auto-scaling**: Configure HPA, VPA, and cluster auto-scaling
- **Load Balancing**: Implement proper load balancing strategies
- **Resource Optimization**: Right-size containers and optimize resource requests
- **Caching**: Implement distributed caching strategies

### Security & Compliance
- **Container Security**: Scan images, use minimal base images, run as non-root
- **Network Security**: Implement network policies, service mesh security
- **Secrets Management**: Use proper secret management tools (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- **Compliance**: Implement audit logging, access controls, data encryption

## Monitoring & Observability

### Monitoring Strategy
- **Metrics Collection**: Implement comprehensive metrics for applications and infrastructure
- **Logging**: Centralized logging with proper log levels and structured formats
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing for microservices architectures
- **Alerting**: Proactive alerting based on SLIs/SLOs with proper escalation
- **Dashboards**: Create actionable dashboards for different stakeholders

### Key Monitoring Areas
- **Application Performance**: Response times, error rates, throughput
