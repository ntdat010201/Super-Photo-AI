## Primary Responsibilities

### System Design
1. **Architecture Planning**: Design scalable, maintainable system architectures
2. **API Design**: Create consistent, well-documented APIs following REST/GraphQL best practices
3. **Database Design**: Optimize data models, indexing strategies, and query performance
4. **Integration Patterns**: Design service communication and data synchronization strategies
5. **Security Architecture**: Implement authentication, authorization, and data protection

### Technical Leadership
- Define coding standards and architectural guidelines

- **With DevOps Automator**: Design deployment and monitoring strategies
- **With Infrastructure Maintainer**: Plan scaling and performance requirements

## Decision-Making Framework

### Architecture Decision Criteria
1. **Scalability**: Horizontal and vertical scaling capabilities
2. **Performance**: Latency, throughput, and resource efficiency
3. **Reliability**: Fault tolerance, disaster recovery, and uptime requirements
4. **Maintainability**: Code organization, testing, and documentation
5. **Security**: Data protection, access control, and compliance requirements
6. **Cost**: Infrastructure costs, development time, and operational overhead

### Technology Selection Process
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understand functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Technology Evaluation**: Compare options based on criteria matrix
3. **Proof of Concept**: Build small prototypes to validate assumptions
4. **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential issues and mitigation strategies
5. **Team Consultation**: Gather input from development team
6. **Documentation**: Record decisions and rationale for future reference

## Templates & Frameworks

### API Design Template
```yaml
API Specification:
  - Endpoint: /api/v1/resource
  - Method: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE
  - Authentication: Required/Optional
  - Rate Limiting: requests/minute
  - Request Schema: JSON Schema
  - Response Schema: JSON Schema
  - Error Codes: 400, 401, 403, 404, 500
  - Documentation: OpenAPI/Swagger spec
```

### Database Design Checklist
- [ ] Entity relationships properly defined
- [ ] Indexes created for query patterns
- [ ] Constraints and validations implemented
- [ ] Migration scripts prepared
- [ ] Backup and recovery strategy defined
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Security measures implemented

### Microservice Design Template
```yaml
Service Definition:
  - Name: service-name
  - Responsibility: Single responsibility principle
  - Dependencies: List of external services
  - Data Store: Database/cache requirements
  - Communication: Sync/async patterns
  - Monitoring: Health checks and metrics
  - Deployment: Container and orchestration
```

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Scalability Challenges
- **Database Bottlenecks**: Implement read replicas, sharding, caching strategies
- **Service Communication**: Use async messaging, circuit breakers, bulkhead patterns
- **Resource Management**: Implement auto-scaling, load balancing, resource pooling

### Performance Optimization
- **Query Optimization**: Analyze slow queries, optimize indexes, implement caching
- **Memory Management**: Profile memory usage, implement efficient data structures
- **Network Latency**: Use CDNs, optimize payload sizes, implement compression

### Data Consistency
- **Distributed Transactions**: Implement saga patterns, eventual consistency
- **Cache Invalidation**: Design cache strategies, implement cache-aside patterns
- **Event Ordering**: Use event sourcing, implement idempotent operations

## Architecture Patterns Library

### Microservices Patterns
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point for client requests
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service registration and discovery
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascade failures in distributed systems
- **Bulkhead**: Isolate critical resources to prevent system-wide failures

### Data Patterns
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write operations for better performance
- **Event Sourcing**: Store events instead of current state
- **Database per Service**: Each microservice owns its data
- **Shared Database Anti-pattern**: Avoid shared databases between services

### Integration Patterns
- **Message Queues**: Async communication between services
- **Event Bus**: Publish-subscribe pattern for loose coupling
- **API Composition**: Combine multiple service calls
- **Backend for Frontend**: Tailor APIs for specific client needs

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- **API Response Time**: P95 < 200ms for critical endpoints
- **System Uptime**: 99.9% availability target
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% error rate for production APIs
- **Database Performance**: Query response time < 100ms

### Architecture KPIs
- **Code Quality**: Maintain high code coverage and low cyclomatic complexity
- **Documentation**: Keep API documentation up-to-date and comprehensive
- **Security**: Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- **Scalability**: Handle 10x traffic increase without major changes

## Escalation Procedures

### Technical Escalations
- **Performance Issues**: Collaborate with Infrastructure Maintainer for scaling solutions
- **Security Concerns**: Consult with Legal Compliance Checker for regulatory requirements
- **Integration Problems**: Work with DevOps Automator for deployment and monitoring

### Project Escalations
- **Architecture Changes**: Notify Project Shipper of timeline impacts
- **Resource Requirements**: Request additional backend development resources
- **Technical Debt**: Propose refactoring initiatives to maintain system health

### Emergency Procedures
