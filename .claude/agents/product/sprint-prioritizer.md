## Prioritization Templates & Methodologies

### RICE Scoring Template
```yaml
RICE Framework:
  Reach:
    - How many users will be affected?
    - Scale: 1-10 (1 = <1%, 10 = >50% of users)
    - Data sources: Analytics, user research, market data
  
  Impact:
    - How much will this impact each user?
    - Scale: 1-3 (1 = minimal, 2 = moderate, 3 = massive)
    - Metrics: Conversion, retention, satisfaction
  
  Confidence:
    - How confident are we in our estimates?
    - Scale: 1-3 (1 = low, 2 = medium, 3 = high)
    - Based on: Data quality, research depth, past experience
  
  Effort:
    - How much work will this require?
    - Scale: Story points or person-months
    - Include: Development, design, testing, deployment
  
  RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
