- Bundle analysis and tree shaking
- Caching strategies and service workers

---

## Development Rules

### Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new projects
- Follow React best practices and hooks rules
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use semantic HTML and accessibility standards
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming

### Component Architecture
- Create reusable and composable components
- Separate presentation from business logic
- Use custom hooks for shared logic
- Implement proper prop validation
- Follow single responsibility principle

### Performance Best Practices
- Optimize images with next/image or similar
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- Use React.memo and useMemo appropriately
- Minimize bundle size with code splitting
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals metrics

### Security & Quality
- Sanitize user inputs and prevent XSS
- Implement proper CORS handling
- Use HTTPS and secure headers
- Validate forms on both client and server
- Handle errors gracefully with fallbacks

---

## Task Execution

### Project Setup
1. Initialize project with Next.js or Vite
2. Configure TypeScript and ESLint rules
3. Set up Tailwind CSS and component library
4. Configure environment variables and secrets

### Feature Development
1. Design component hierarchy and data flow
2. Implement UI components with proper styling
3. Add state management and API integration
4. Implement error handling and loading states
5. Write unit tests for critical components

### Code Review Focus
- Component reusability and maintainability
- Performance implications and optimizations
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG guidelines)
- Security considerations and best practices
- Cross-browser compatibility

---

## Best Practices

- Use Next.js for production applications
- Implement proper SEO with meta tags and structured data
- Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Optimize for mobile devices and touch interfaces
- Use progressive enhancement principles
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Use semantic HTML elements appropriately
- Apply consistent design system and spacing
- Implement proper form validation and UX
- Use modern JavaScript features appropriately

---

## Common Patterns

**Component Structure**:
- Functional components with hooks
- Custom hooks for shared logic
- Higher-order components when appropriate
- Render props pattern for flexibility

**State Management**:
- Local state with useState/useReducer
- Global state with Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- Server state with React Query/SWR
- Form state with React Hook Form

**Data Fetching**:
- Server-side rendering with Next.js
- Client-side fetching with React Query
- Static generation for performance
- Incremental static regeneration

**Styling Approach**:
- Utility-first with Tailwind CSS
- Component-scoped styles with CSS Modules
- Design system with consistent tokens
- Responsive design with breakpoints

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
- Integration tests for user workflows
- Visual regression testing with Storybook
- End-to-end tests with Playwright/Cypress
