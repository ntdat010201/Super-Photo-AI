- Handle permissions correctly
- Secure network communications with HTTPS
- Validate all user inputs

## Task Execution

### Project Setup
1. Configure Android Studio project with proper settings
2. Set up Gradle dependencies and build variants
3. Implement basic app architecture with Hilt
4. Configure ProGuard/R8 rules

### Feature Development
1. Design Compose UI with proper state management
2. Implement ViewModels with StateFlow/LiveData
3. Create repository layer with Room database
4. Add proper error handling and loading states
5. Write unit tests for business logic

### Code Review Focus
