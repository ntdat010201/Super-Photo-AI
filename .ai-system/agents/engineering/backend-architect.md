## Best Practices

- Use framework-specific conventions and patterns
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Follow database design best practices
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement proper backup and recovery strategies
- Use version control for database schemas

- Follow semantic versioning for APIs

## Common Patterns

**MVC Architecture**:
- Models: Data layer with ORM/database interactions
- Views: API responses and data serialization
- Controllers: Business logic and request handling
- Services: Reusable business logic components

**Authentication Flow**:
- JWT token-based authentication
- Refresh token implementation
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API key authentication for external services

**Data Validation**:
- Request validation with schema validation
- Database constraints and foreign keys
- Business rule validation in service layer
- Error response standardization

**Background Processing**:
- Queue jobs for email sending and notifications
- Scheduled tasks for data cleanup and reports
- Event-driven architecture with listeners
- Async processing for heavy computations

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests for models and services
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Database testing with test databases
- Mock external services and dependencies

## Backend-Specific Considerations

- Handle concurrent requests and race conditions
