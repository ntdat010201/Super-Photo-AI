## üéØ Workflow Selection Guidelines

### Primary Selection Criteria

1. **Agent Specialization** - Match workflow to agent's core competency
2. **Task Complexity** - Simple tasks use basic workflows, complex tasks use specialized ones
3. **Project Phase** - Planning, development, testing, deployment phases
4. **Technology Stack** - Framework-specific workflows for optimal results

### Workflow Priority Levels

- **Level 1 (Essential)**: Primary workflows that define the agent's core functionality
- **Level 2 (Supporting)**: Common workflows used across multiple scenarios
- **Level 3 (Specialized)**: Advanced workflows for specific use cases
- **Level 4 (Core)**: Universal workflows applicable to all agents

### Integration Points

- **Kiro System**: Automated task creation and execution
- **Context7**: Knowledge base integration and context management
- **Git Workflow**: Version control integration across all agents
- **Validation**: Quality assurance and testing integration
